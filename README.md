back test codes of "forecasting accuracy of strucutral and time series exchange rate models"

How many structural and times series exchange rate models fit properly the out of sample test? Can we really predict future foreign exchange rate? How useful a forecasting future exchange rate is?‚Äù These are serious questions for practitioners in the global financial and business environment. And there are no fixed, final conclusions.  All depends on a purpose of predictions, forecasting period, available data and knowledge of statistics and modeling of people involved. This paper does not provide a miracle solution but show basic guideline to design appropriate evaluation processes. The complete programming codes are open for public via github, therefore readers modify the process to suit for own purpose. Basic guideline consists of two evaluation methods(the direction of fx movements and forecasting accuracy), two model specification(the first difference and VECM), multistep forecast and the out of sample test with cross validation.
